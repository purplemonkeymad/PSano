SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Psano is a nano like text editor that is written in Powershell. It is able
    to edit text files and other Powershell Objects (such as variables.)

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSano is currently able to edit the following object types:
    - Files
    - Remote files over a PSSession
    - Variables
      - Via string conversion.
      - Via Json representation.
    - Function definitions
    - Windows Text Clipboard

NOTE
    Psano is primarily a text editor. This means while you can edit non-text
    objects, you results on the objects may vary. If using the String edit mode
    for variables you may find your edited object is now a string array.
    Function definitions are updated as soon as you save the text, but will only
    affect the current session. Function in jobs will not be affected and
    restarting a session will revert the definitions to their original values.
    Use another command to save your functions if you want to keep them.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
    Psano is an iteractive function. This means that it can only be used in an
    interactive console session. Remote console session or limited logon
    sessions may cause the command to file.
