Function are accessible via the function: psdrive. this drive has
write access so we can just pretend that functions are files.

Unlike files, Get-Content won't split up the definitions on new
lines. So we have to do it ourself.

    Since we have a parameter, we are not going to ask the user to
    include the function drive. Lets just add it ourself.

    I don't think i can figure out what line ending was used before.
    But unix style works in PS and it's not like the changes are
    persistant.
