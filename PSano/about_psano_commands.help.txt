SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Psano has a few keyboard shortcuts that are used to navigate and edit the
    buffer.

COMMAND DISPLAY
    The available commands are displayed with a Key combo and a short name
    separated by a colon, ie: 'C+X: Quit'
    Key combos with a plus '+' are key combos with the first character of the
    modifier key. For example 'C+X' is the same as Control+X. At the moment all
    commands use the Control modifier.

COMMAND LIST
    Psano currently has the following commands:

Quit
    Control+X is used to quit the interface. This will not save the buffer no
    will it prompt to do so.

Save
    Control+O is used to save the buffer to whatever you were editing. If this
    was a non-text object, the conversion will be attempted here. If saving
    fails then the error will be displayed in the header on the first line.

Cut Line
    Control+K, similar to nano, this will remove the current line and place it
    onto the clipboard. You can past the cut line with the Paste Line command,
    or into another program via the windows clipboard.

Paste Line
    Control+U will paste a line or lines of text from the clipboard. If Cut Line
    was previously used then it will paste that line of text.

Copy All
    Control+A will copy the whole buffer as it to the windows clipboard.
